# Overboard üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
*"The floor is lava‚Ä¶ but in a shipwreck!"*

![player jumps between platforms at Imagine RIT](/overboard-in-action.jpg)

Overboard is a **time-based "floor is lava" survival game** where shipwrecked pirates must navigate a hazardous arena, collect doubloons, and avoid peril before the rescue boat arrives. The game takes place in a **10' x 6' play area** using **top-down floor and wall projections**, with player movement tracked via a **Kinect v2 sensor**. The game is built in **Unity 6** for interactive projections and UI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- [**Unity 6** (version 6000.0.37f1)](https://unity.com/releases/unity-6-releases)
- **Windows** device
- [**Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561)

### Steps
1. Install Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0
2. Clone the repo:
   ```sh  
   git clone https://github.com/Overboard-RIT/overboard.git
   ```
3. Open the Unity project in **Unity 6**
4. Use `Tools > Build Video AssetBundle` to preload videos.

## üéÆ Running the Game

1. **Open** the Unity project
2. Click the **Play** button
3. **Calibrate** and play ([see below](#-calibration-process))

---

## üéØ Calibration Process

1. **Set up the Kinect sensor** in a fixed position.
2. **Floor Calibration:** Stand in one corner of the play area, then in the opposite corner. Record the player position as it's logged to the debug console.
3. **Use the recorded values** as the `Min Bounds` and `Max Bounds` values in the `Config` script component.

Calibration ensures accurate player tracking but is not required to simply run the game in Unity.
