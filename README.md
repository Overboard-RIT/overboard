# Overboard 🏴‍☠️
*"The floor is lava… but in a shipwreck!"*

Overboard is a **time-based "floor is lava" survival game** where shipwrecked pirates must navigate a hazardous arena, collect doubloons, and avoid peril before the rescue boat arrives. The game takes place in a **15' x 10' play area** using **top-down floor and wall projections**, with player movement tracked via **two Kinect v2 sensors**. The game is built in **Unity 6** for interactive projections and UI.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- [**Unity 6** (version 6000.0.37f1)](https://unity.com/releases/unity-6-releases)
- **Windows** device
- [**Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561)

### Steps
1. Install Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0
2. Clone the repo:
   ```sh  
   git clone https://github.com/Overboard-RIT/overboard.git
   ```
3. Open the Unity project in **Unity 6**

## 🎮 Running the Game

1. Open the Unity project
2. Click the **Play** button

*Note: While the game will launch, **calibration is required for proper Kinect alignment.** See below.*

---

## 🎯 Calibration Process (in development)

1. **Set up the Kinect sensors** in fixed positions.
2. **Floor Calibration:** Stand in one corner of the play area, then in the opposite corner. This allows the game to map the floor space.
3. **Camera Alignment:** Move a reference dot to the calibrator’s position to sync the Unity camera with Kinect coordinates.

This step ensures accurate player tracking but is not required just to run the game in Unity.
